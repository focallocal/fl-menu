This is a solution for a global menu that should be included over all the
focallocal websites. It provides easy navigation within the focallocal network.
It can be included with a single script-tag.

# how to use

Include the script on the desired page with a script tag after closing the body.

> <script src="http://server/fl-menu/fl-menu.js"></script>

The script automatically includes `fl-menu.css` and `materialze.css`, which is
served from a content delivery network.
