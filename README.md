This is a solution for a global menu that should be included over all the
focallocal websites. It provides easy navigation within the focallocal network.
The goal was to provide an easy way to include it with a single script source.

# how to use

Include the script on the desired page with a script tag after closing the body.

> <script src="http://server/fl-menu/fl-menu.js"></script>

The script automatically includes `fl-menu.css` and `materialze.css`, which is
served from a content delivery network.
